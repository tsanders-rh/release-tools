# Stale Issues Historical Data

This directory contains daily snapshots of stale issues and pull requests across Konveyor repositories.

## Data Format

Each file is named `YYYY-MM-DD.json` and contains:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-01T02:00:00.000Z",
  "date": "2025-11-01",
  "totals": {
    "repositories": 5,
    "totalStale": 42,
    "staleIssues": 30,
    "stalePRs": 12
  },
  "repositories": [
    {
      "org": "konveyor",
      "repo": "analyzer-lsp",
      "totalStale": 10,
      "staleIssues": 7,
      "stalePRs": 3,
      "items": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Data Collection

Data is automatically collected by the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/collect-stale-history.yml`.

The workflow runs daily at 2:00 AM UTC and commits new data files to this directory.

## Retention

By default, all historical data is retained. You may want to implement a retention policy to:
- Keep daily snapshots for the last 90 days
- Keep weekly snapshots for older data
- Archive very old data

This can be implemented by modifying the collection workflow.

## What This Does

- Adds a GitHub Actions workflow that runs daily at 2:00 AM UTC
- Collects current counts of stale issues and PRs from all configured repositories
- Commits daily snapshots to \`dashboard/data/history/\`
- Enables historical trend analysis in the stale issues dashboard

## How It Works

The workflow:
1. Reads the repository list from \`stale-dashboard/config.js\`
2. Queries the GitHub API for issues/PRs with the \`stale\` label
3. Generates a JSON file with date, totals, and per-repository breakdowns
4. Commits the file to the repository

## Dashboard Integration

Once this is merged and the workflow runs, the dashboard at \`stale-dashboard/index.html\` will automatically:
- Display trend charts showing stale items over time
- Show repository breakdowns
- Allow filtering by time period (30/60/90 days, etc.)

## Required Settings

After merging, ensure workflow write permissions are enabled:
1. Go to Settings > Actions > General
2. Under \"Workflow permissions\", select \"Read and write permissions\"
3. Click \"Save\"

## Testing

You can manually trigger the workflow after merging:
\`\`\`bash
gh workflow run collect-stale-history.yml
\`\`\`

The workflow will also run automatically daily at 2:00 AM UTC." 2>&1)
